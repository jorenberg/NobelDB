## NobelDBÂ®
<i>A Dedicated Database of Nobel Laureates</i>.

## Data Collection
<b>Before</b>, I even started searching online I already had an idea in my head about the data that I wanted to play with this month; all Nobel Prize Winners in their fields since the very first <b>Nobel Prize in 1901</b>.

### About Nobel Foundation
Thankfully, the <b>Nobel Foundation</b> & [Nobelprize.org](http://www.nobelprize.org/) - is a registered trademark, and is produced, managed and maintained by Nobel Media, had created exactly the database of information for every Nobel Prize since 1901, including the Nobel Laureate's biographies, Nobel Lectures, interviews, photos, articles, video clips, and press releases. Nobelprize.org provides comprehensive, first-hand information about the Nobel Prize and Nobel Laureates in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature and Peace starting in 1901, as well as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel and the Economics Laureates starting in 1969.
