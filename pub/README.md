## NobelDB®
<i>A Dedicated Database of Nobel Laureates</i>.

## Data Collection
<b>Before</b>, I even started searching online I already had an idea in my head about the data that I wanted to play with this month; all Nobel Prize Winners in their fields since the very first <b>Nobel Prize in 1901</b>.

### About Nobel Foundation
Thankfully, the <b>Nobel Foundation</b> & [Nobelprize.org](http://www.nobelprize.org/) - is a registered trademark, and is produced, managed and maintained by Nobel Media, had created exactly the database of information for every Nobel Prize since 1901, including the Nobel Laureate's biographies, Nobel Lectures, interviews, photos, articles, video clips, and press releases. Nobelprize.org provides comprehensive, first-hand information about the Nobel Prize and Nobel Laureates in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature and Peace starting in 1901, as well as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel and the Economics Laureates starting in 1969.

I would like to thanks, the 'Nobel Foundation' — had created exactly this dataset right before the 2016 Nobel Prize Announcements. Why, I have come to Nobel Foundation, because there wasn't any other place that had the data as nicely structured and informative.<br/><br/>After, 2016 Nobel Prize Announcements — I "only" needed to add the prizes for 2016. Again the Nobel Foundation helped out by supplying a dataset with all of the Nobel Laureates from 1901.

### Nobel Facts
When, I got the raw data, primarily some facts — I have obtained:
- The Nobel Peace Prize — has been awarded 96 times to 129 Nobel Laureates between 1901 and 2015, 103 individuals and 26 organizations. Since the International Committee of the Red Cross has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize three times (in 1917, 1944 and 1963), and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize two times (in 1954 and 1981), there are 23 individual organizations which have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
- The Nobel Prize in Physics — has been awarded 109 times to 201 Nobel Laureates between 1901 and 2015. John Bardeen is the only Nobel Laureate who has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics twice, in 1956 and 1972. This means that a total of 200 individuals have received the Nobel Prize in Physics.
- The Nobel Prize in Chemistry — has been awarded 107 times to 172 Nobel Laureates between 1901 and 2015. Frederick Sanger is the only Nobel Laureate who has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry twice, in 1958 and 1980. This means that a total of 171 individuals have received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
- The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine — has been awarded 106 times to 210 Nobel Laureates between 1901 and 2015.
- The Nobel Prize in Literature — has been awarded 108 times to 112 Nobel Laureates between 1901 and 2015.
